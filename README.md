# Loss-Function-in-Neural-Network
Means Absolute Error, Mean Square Error & Log Loss or Binary cross Entropy

Binary cross-entropy tells the model, “How close are your predicted probabilities to the real answers?” and is perfect for 0/1 predictions.

In this project we cover MAE & Log Loss or Binary Cross Entropy.
